## Buy & Sell Simulator
- Trader can observe how the stock is behaving in the market based on his/her indicators and signals selections
- Indicators and Signals can be added/removed at run time.
- Selected indicators and signals are key part in the buy/sell simulation process
- Trader can visualize the market and compare between those indicators

## Buy & Sell Simulator (Cont.)
- Trader can select the price source among *Yahoo*, *Qundl* and *Alpha Vantage*
- Trader can zoom the market chart in to include shorter period and out to include longer period.
